--BOOTSTRAP GRID SYSTEM
  -Built with flexbox and is fully responsive
  -It's designed to look nice when the screen size changes
  -Though this happens automatically, you can still customize how things change to get the effect you want
   -Zoom is built with bootstrap
   -Containers, rows, and columns are all added to elements as classes.

 -There are 6 default breakpoints in Bootstrap (screen sizes):
 Extra small (xs)
 Small (sm)
 Medium (md)
 Large (lg)
 Extra large (xl)
 Extra extra large (xxl)

----------------------------------------------------
--CONTAINERS
   -Bootstrap uses containers, rows, and columns to control the layout and alignment of the page.
   -Containers are the most basic layout element Bootstrap, and the grid system will not work without them. They will usually contain the entire project, and you usually only need 1 for the entire project.
   -There are 3 different containers: the regular container creates a side margin for each breakpoint; container-fluid takes up the full width of the screen no matter what; container-sm (or any breakpoint) is full width until the specified breakpoint.


----------------------------------------------------
--ROWS
  -Rows are the second basic layout element.
  -Rows can't exist outside of a container
  -Rows can be nested in other rows, as long as the parent row is inside of a container
  -You can have one container for your whole project, and fill it with rows.
  -Content inside a row moves horizontally from left to right.
Rows can be tall

----------------------------------------------------
--COLUMNS
 -Columns are the final basic layout element
 -The bootstrap heiarchy goes container, row, column
 -Columns are placed inside rows
 -Columns vertically break up the content inside of rows.
 -Each row can hold up to 12 columns
 -Columns are as tall as the row they're in. 
 -Most of your content will be inside columns.


----------------------------------------------------
--COMPONENTS
 -Components are popular pieces like buttons, forms, navbars; they're also complicated ones that would be difficult to build by hand, such as carousels and accordions. 
 -They're copied and pasted directly into html. 
 -The css classes attached to a given component can be changed in css. 
 -Source code can be found for components either by using google, or adding a raw component and inspecting the html; the class name from the inspection can be added into your css page and changed accordingly.
