        <h4 id="list-item-1">Salsa</h4>
        <p>Salsa is a Latin dance associated with the music genre of the same name which was first popularized in the
            United States in the 1960s in New York City. Salsa is an amalgamation of Cuban dances such mambo, pachanga,
            and rumba as well as American dances such as swing and tap.
            Over the years many different styles of salsa dancing have evolved around the world. Many of them are
            compatible with each other, but others are different enough to make dancing between dancers of different
            styles difficult.
            Incorporating other dance styling techniques into salsa dancing has also become common, with dancers of one
            style incorporating styles and movements of others to create new fusions of dan…-wikepedia

        <h4 id="list-item-2">Bachata</h4>
        <p>Bachata is a style of dance that originated in the Dominican Republic. It is danced widely all over the world
            but not identically. The basics to the dance are three-step with a Cuban hip motion, followed by a hip tap
            on the 4th beat just like in other Latin dances (salsa etc.).-arthur murray dance school</p>
        <h4 id="list-item-3">Cumbia</h4>
        <p>Cumbia is originally a Colombian folk dance and dance music and is Colombia's representative national dance
            and music along with vallenato. Cumbia is very popular, widely known in the Latin music mainstream
            throughout South America, Central America and Mexico, with lots of regional variations and tendencies.</p>
        <h4 id="list-item-4">Mambo</h4>
        <p>Mambo is a Latin dance of Cuba which was developed in the 1940s when the music genre of the same name became
            popular throughout Latin America. The original ballroom dance which emerged in Cuba and Mexico was related
            to the danzón, albeit faster and less rigid. In the United States, it replaced rhumba as the most
            fashionable Latin dance. Later on, with the advent of salsa and its more sophisticated dance, a new type of
            mambo dance including breaking steps was popularized in New York. This form received the name of "salsa on
            2", "mambo on 2" or "modern mambo".-wikipedia</p>
        <h4 id="list-item-5">Tango</h4>
        <p>Tango is a partner dance that originated in the 1890s along the Río de la Plata, the natural border between
            Uruguay and Argentina, and soon spread to the rest of the world. Early tango was known as tango criollo.
            Today, there are many forms of tango extant. Popularly and among tango dancing circles, the authentic tango
            is considered to be the one closest to the form originally danced in Argentina and Uruguay. In 2009, UNESCO
            approved a joint proposal by Argentina and Uruguay to include the tango in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural
            Heritage Lists.</p>
