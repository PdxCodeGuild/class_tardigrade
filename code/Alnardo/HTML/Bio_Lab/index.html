        <h1>John Rambo</h1>
        <hr/>
        <p>John James Rambo was born July 6th, 1947. Growing up, he was the popular kid in school, the perfect athlete, made friends with everyone, and then at the age of 17 he got drafted into the Army. After completing high school, his military career began in 1966 where he went through basic training in January until he got deployed to Vietnam in September. He managed to survive and got recruited to the Army Special Forces in 1967 and trained with his new squad, "Baker Team", until they got redeployed again in 1969. In 1971, while in Vietnam, John and his squad got captured by North Vietnamese forces and tortured for months before finally managing to escape, but at this point only John and one member of his team was still alive. Upon returning from his capture, John immediately requested to be re-deployed and kept fighting until his official discharge in 1974. After being discharged, John returned to a different US than he left. This new United States would spit on him, degrade him constantly, going so far as to call him a "baby killer". After  years of trying to find a place in society, John eventually becomes a drifter and tries to find an old member of his squad, only to find out that he died of cancer and John is now the last surviving member of his squad. This leads into the first movie, 'Rambo: First Blood'. For more information, click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rambo">here.</a></p>
