Lab 17: Quotes API

For this lab we'll be using the Favqs Quotes API to first get a random quote, and then allow the user to find quotes by ' \
'keyword. To accomplish this we'll be using the requests library.
Version 1: Get a Random Quote

The URL to get a random quote is https://favqs.com/api/qotd, send a request here, parse the JSON in the response into
a python dictionary, and show the quote and the author.
