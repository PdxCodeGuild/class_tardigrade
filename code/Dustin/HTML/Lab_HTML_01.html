    <h2>Iron Mother Directrix</h2>

    <p style="text-align:center;">Directrix: <q><span style= "font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Demi'">Nothing must imperil The Great Work.</q></p>
    <p>Directrix’s Mathematical Perfection feat wouldn’t mean much to a warcaster like Kommandant Irusk and would be
        downright terrible for someone like Lieutenant Allister Caine, but this elegant feat makes a real difference
        for the Iron Mother. Mathematical Perfection reads: Directrix’s MAT and RAT are each equal to her FOCUS for
        one turn.</p>

    <ul list-label="Known area of operation:">
        <li>Cygnar</li>
        <li>Khador</li>
        <li>Protectorate of Menoth</li>
        <li>Ord</li>
        <li>Rul</li>
        <li>Lael</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For everyone following along at home, this means Directrix’s vectors will also have MAT 8 and RAT 8 during her feat
        turn. Throw in the Flare effect from an Attunement Servitor or a Cipher to crank that up to an effective
        MAT 10 and RAT 10 against any really hard-to-hit targets. You’ll want to hold back Mathematical Perfection
        until the right moment to unleash a flurry of accurate attacks from Directrix and her battlegroup. Speaking of
        Directrix’s own attacks, that cloak of blades weighs in at P+S 11 with Reach and the Thresher special attack,
        while the blasts of energy she can unleash have RNG 11 with POW 15 and a 4˝ AOE. What more could one ask for?</p>

    <p>Oh, right, with such an accuracy-oriented feat, one could ask for a way Directrix and her army could deal a bit more
        damage to their enemies. Well, that’s where her Exponent Servitors come into play. Directrix leads WARMACHINE’s
        first warcaster unit, which includes a pair of Exponent Servitors. Though these servitors do not cause damage,
        their RNG 10 beams have the Imperil effect, imbuing a target model/unit with susceptibility to attacks, meaning
        you gain +2 to every damage roll that model/unit suffers for one round.</p>

    <p>Servitors are not the sturdiest constructs, but during her control phase Directrix can release an additional Exponent
        Servitor if she is currently controlling fewer than two. She can also be repaired, just like other clockwork
        vessels in the Convergence of Cyriss army, and has quite a few damage boxes for such a high-FOCUS warcaster.</p>

    <p>While I wouldn’t be permitted to give away everything about this warcaster, I’ll close with a couple of the Iron
        Mother’s spells. Considering that she can be a bit manipulative and scheming, I’ll showcase the two spells that
        most closely embody those elements of her character. Directrix has Backlash (previously from Kaelyssa, Night’s
        Whisper or Pirate Queen Skarre) along with Domination (from Major Victoria Haley). Plus, she’s got a great
        offensive spell in Shrapnel Swarm and a couple of support spells to top it all off.</p>
