            <h1>Quotes By Elon Musk</h1>
            <blockquote>“I could either watch it happen or be a part of it.” - Elon Musk</blockquote>

            <blockquote>“The first step is to establish that something is possible; then probability will occur.” - Elon
                Musk</blockquote>

            <blockquote>“Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough.” - Elon
                Musk</blockquote>

            <blockquote>“When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.” - Elon
                Musk</blockquote>

            <blockquote>"There have to be reasons that you get up in the morning and you want to live. Why do you want
                to live?
                What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? If the future does not include
                being out there among the stars and being a multi-planet species, I find that incredibly depressing." -
